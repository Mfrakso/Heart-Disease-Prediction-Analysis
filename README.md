# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis
This project is a heart disease prediction analysis using machine learning and data visualization techniques. The analysis is performed on a dataset containing various medical attributes related to heart disease, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more. The goal is to predict whether a person has heart disease (binary classification).

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training using various machine learning algorithms, and model evaluation using techniques such as cross-validation, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.

Prerequisites

numpy (for numerical operations)
pandas (for data manipulation)
matplotlib (for data visualization)
seaborn (for statistical plots)
scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms and metrics)
os (for interacting with the operating system)
warnings (for managing warnings)
